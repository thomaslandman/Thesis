5-1-21: Tried to recover and retype as much as the code I had up to this point. As it stands now I believe everything
    untill the single task registration and segmentation works again. Also put everything correctly in VCS. Removed the
    resampling from the overlap_quantification, since images had different dimensions. Check tomorrow if is also needed
    with registration. Now eval for seg a/b running and inference for reg b.
